                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>It is a habit of philosophers to ask annoying questions. 
                        Ask "What is a quantum computer?" and you will likely receive the response 
                        "Well, what is a (classical) computer, anyway?" (the "anyway" is very important…)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But questions which may seem annoying can be deep and fascinating. The question "what is a computer?" 
                        let alone "what is a quantum computer?" is one such question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's begin by making an important distinction: that between the abstract 
                        notion of a computer and the concrete implementation of it. There are computer-instances 
                        everywhere - your phone, laptop, watch or calculator. In the last century, some computer-instances 
                        were human. But they are all computers - they all instantiate the abstract notion of "computer". 
                        Although they are programmed to perform different functions, they all do fundamentally 
                        the same thing: they all consist of a <em>state</em> and some <em>rules</em> for changing that state.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        For classical computers, the state is a sequence of <em>bits</em> which can take one of two 
                        values (0 or 1) and the rules for changing this sequence of bits are given by the <em>logic gates</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Quantum computers are still computers: they consist of a state and rules for changing 
                        that state. But in this case, the state is represented as a sequence of quantum bits or 
                        <em>qubits</em> and the rules for changing that state are represented by <em>quantum logic gates</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Still, although this may technically answer our question, it does not enlighten us. 
                        One of the questions we really want insight on, of course, it what it is about qubits and quantum 
                        logic gates which give quantum computing its supposed advantage over classical computers. 
                        Which inherently quantum feature is responsible for, or explains, the advantage? 
                        And what is that advantage (anyway)?
                    </p>

                <div id="superposition-and-entanglement">
                    <h2>SUPERPOSITION AND ENTANGLEMENT</h2>
                    <p>Two fundamental concepts in quantum theory are often linked to the explanation 
                        of quantum speedup: superposition and entanglement. We must try to understand 
                        these to get insight into our question. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite people's best efforts, there is no simultaneously precise and comprehensible 
                        explication of these ideas. Various attempts usually exhibit a trade-off between precision 
                        and comprehensibility. I choose to be precise: these ideas are quantum, and therefore 
                        non-classical, and therefore not amenable to classical explications. And since we generally 
                        go about understanding the world through a classical lens, quantum theory is going to be tough to get a grip on.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        <strong>Superposition</strong>: if the state of a qubit can be \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\) then another 
                        possible state of the qubit is \(\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle\), where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex numbers such that \(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1\)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Entanglement</strong>: the global state of two entangled systems cannot be described in terms 
                        of the state of the individual systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        All hope of insight or understanding is not lost entirely, however. Much understanding of 
                        superposition and entanglement can be gained with a sensible and careful comparison between 
                        classical and quantum states. Here is a simple example of the state of a 4-bit classical computer:
                        
                       $$
                        0_{A}1_{B}1_{C}0_{D}
                       $$
                        
                        This says: bit \(A\) has state 0, bit \(B\) has state 1, bit \(C\) has state 1 and bit \(D\) has state 
                        0. This makes the state of the computer as a whole, the global state, just the collection of the 
                        individual states of the classical bits. This is all there is to say about the state of classical computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        For a 4-qubit quantum computer, it is possible to have an exactly analogous situation:
                        
                       $$
                        |0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B|1\rangle_C|0\rangle_D
                       $$
                        
                        This says that qubit \(A\) has state \(|0\rangle\), qubit \(B\) has state \(|1\rangle\) qubit \(C\) has 
                        state \(|1\rangle\) and qubit \(D\) has state \(|0\rangle\). This makes the state of the computer as a 
                        whole, the global state, just the collection of the individual states of the qubits. But this is 
                        certainly not all there is to say about quantum computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Because of superposition, if \(|0\rangle_A\) and \(|1\rangle_A\) are possible states of qubit \(A\), 
                        then \(\alpha|1\rangle_A + \beta|0\rangle_A\) is also a possible state of qubit \(A\). This linear superposition 
                        is a mathematical fact of quantum theory. The interpretation of \(|1\rangle\) and \(|0\rangle\) as states 
                        of the qubit is what generates the weirdness: how is it possible for the qubit to be simultaneously 
                        in states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\)? By contrast, to say that \(0_A + 1_A\) is a possible classical 
                        state of bit \(A\) is just nonsense.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        On to entanglement. The explication I gave above said that the joint, or "global", state of entangled 
                        quantum systems \(A\) and \(B\) cannot be broken down into the individual states of \(A\) and \(B\). To 
                        understand why this is totally bizarre, consider the global state of the 4-bit classical computer 
                        I described above: in this case, the global state is described precisely by listing the state of the 
                        individual bits. In fact, it is hard to imagine any other way of describing the global state other 
                        than just saying what state its constituent parts are in. We may say in this case that the parts are 
                        prior to the whole. In a similar way, we have the global state of the 4-qubit quantum system explained above. 
                        This state can be described in terms of the state of its parts because it is not an entangled quantum state.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        But here is an example of an entangled quantum state: \(|1\rangle_A|0\rangle_B + |0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B\). 
                        In this case, we say that systems \(A\) and \(B\) are entangled. This state cannot be broken down 
                        (mathematically speaking, factorized) into the state of \(A\) and the state of \(B\). It is just mathematically 
                        impossible to describe the global state in terms of the individual states. In fact, it is not a stretch to 
                        say that, for this state, \(A\) and \(B\) do not have well-defined individual states. They only have a well-defined 
                        joint, global state. In a sense then, for entangled states, somehow the whole is prior to the parts.

                    <h2>FEYNMAN AND THE GENESIS OF QUANTUM COMPUTATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        With this understanding under our belts, we are in a position to think about why quantum computers 
                        were conceived in the first place. What sort of problems were quantum computers meant to crack, 
                        and why can't existing classical computers do it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This insight from Richard Feynman, right at the genesis of quantum computation, answers these questions:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            "The rule of simulation that I would like to have is that the number of computer elements required 
                            to simulate a large physical system is only to be proportional to the space-time volume of the physical 
                            system. I don't want to have an explosion. That is, if you say I want to explain this much physics, 
                            I can do it exactly and I need a certain-sized computer. If doubling the volume of space and time means 
                            I'll need an exponentially larger computer, I consider that against the rules (I make up the rules, 
                            I'm allowed to do that)."
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Feynman's 'rule' aims to place a sanity constraint on the size of computer used to model a 
                        physical system. Suppose we have a physical system which requires a computer of a certain 
                        size to model. Then suppose we come across a physical system twice the size. If the size of 
                        the computer doubles, fine. If the size of the computer increases by, say factor \(4=2^2\), not 
                        fine, because this would be an "exponentially larger computer". If four times the size of computer 
                        for twice the size of the physical system might not seem bad, consider a physical system ten times the size. 
                        On this understanding, this would require a computer \(2^{10}=1024\) times bigger. 
                        We end up in a situation where the model does not scale manageably with the size of the system; 
                        it scales exponentially. Therefore, as the size of the system increases, it quickly becomes 
                        impossible to model; very quickly, as we scale the physical system, the computers become 
                        either unbuildable or take too long to run the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this is all speaking abstractly. A concrete example of this phenomenon is where we try 
                        to model quantum systems with classical computers. Indeed, this is exactly what Feynman had in mind, and is of particular 
                        relevance to chemistry where scientists attempt to model molecules as quantum systems on classical  (super) computers.
                        To understand why such modelling is so difficult, according to Feynman, I will give a simple argument for why the size 
                        of classical computer required to model quantum systems scales exponentially with the size of the quantum system.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Consider a two classical-bit system: they can be in one of \(2^2=4\) possible states \(0_A0_B, 0_A1_B, 1_A0_B\) and \(1_A1_B\). 
                        For \(n\) bits, there are \(2^n\) possible states.

                        Now consider a two qubit system. Initially, the situation looks similar: we can have four possible 'basis' 
                        states \(|0\rangle_A|0\rangle_B\), \(|0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B\), \(|1\rangle_A|0\rangle_B\) and \(|1\rangle_A|1\rangle_B\).
                        But because of superposition, 
                        now \(\alpha|00\rangle +\) \(\beta|01\rangle +\) \(\gamma|10\rangle +\) \(\delta|11\rangle\) (where \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), 
                        \(\gamma\) and \(\delta\) are complex numbers such that \(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2+|\gamma|^2+|\delta|^2=1\)) also counts as a possible 
                        state of the computer, in addition to the four basis states already listed. How many more bits of 
                        information are required now to describe the state of this quantum system? Since we need more bits to 
                        store the information about the numbers \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\) we need \(4=2^2\) more bits. 
                        For \(n\) bits we need \(2^n\) more bits to classically model the quantum state. (In fact it's at least \(2.2^n\) 
                        because these constants are complex numbers for which need two real numbers to represent). 

                        The point is, because you also need to represent these constants and there are \(2^n\) of them, 
                        this represents the exponential blow-up in the size of computer needed to model this quantum system.

                    <h2>ARE QUANTUM COMPUTERS 'BETTER'?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If that explains why you will find it difficult to model quantum systems on a 
                        classical computer, it doesn't really explain why quantum computers are 
                        somehow "better" or "more performant" than classical computers. Let's 
                        explore what that might mean. I think the result of this exploration is rather 
                        surprising. To give a preview, let's consider what we might mean by "better". 
                        Here are some plausible interpretations of "better". Does "better" mean:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>More compact?</li>
                        <li>Easier to build?</li>
                        <li>Faster?</li>
                        <li>More capable?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The answers, which I think are rather surprising are "No", "No", "It depends" 
                        and "No". I will explain shortly what I mean by "capable". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm going to focus on interpretations 3 and 4. The way I see it, these are the 
                        fundamental questions, whereas 1 and 2 really speak to the engineering problems 
                        in building quantum computers, something I do not touch on here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin with 3. What does it mean for one computer to be "faster" than another? 
                        There are two senses of "fast", as I see it. The laptop or phone you are reading 
                        this on is faster than the bricks we had back in the year 2000 because it has more 
                        processing power and can run whatever algorithm in a shorter time. This is due to 
                        better hardware design, usually in the form of greater transistor density. This sense 
                        of "fast" is a hardware innovation. Is this the sense in which quantum computers 
                        are faster? No. Of course, some quantum-computer-instance may be faster in this 
                        sense than some classical-computer-instance (no doubt modern quantum computers 
                        are faster at Algorithm A then classical-computer-instances of yesteryear). Some 
                        classical-computer-instance may be faster than some other quantum-computer-instance. 
                        Some quantum-computer-instances are faster than other quantum-computer-instances 
                        at returning the result of an algorithm. But this is not the sense of "fast" meant 
                        in the context of quantum speedup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another sense of "fast" is this. Algorithm B may be faster at returning a result 
                        than Algorithm A for some problem. For example, we know that the General Number 
                        Field Sieve (GNFS) algorithm is more performant than the Trial Division Algorithm for 
                        factorising integers into their prime factors; in general, it would take Trial 
                        Division much longer than GNFS to factorise the number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The existence of faster algorithms is partly due to the creativity of mathematicians 
                        in designing more performant algorithms. Algorithm design is an inherently creative 
                        endeavour. It must be, for if it were not creative, it would be algorithmic, and if 
                        there were an algorithm for generating better algorithms to solve a particular problem, 
                        we would have all the best algorithms already. And we don't, so algorithm design is creative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it is crucial to remember that the performance of algorithms is strictly 
                        constrained by the architecture of the computer they run on. Classical algorithms 
                        are those algorithms which run on a classical computer and are designed with the 
                        architecture of the classical computer in mind: the algorithm tries to make the 
                        most efficient use of the classical bits and logic gates implemented in the hardware 
                        to solve the problem efficiently. A good example of this is the 
                        Quicksort sorting algorithm. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach that aligns with 
                        sequential processing nature of classical computers, implements in-place sorting to 
                        minimize memory usage, and leverages cache efficiency through its partitioning strategy. 
                        These characteristics make quicksort particularly well-suited for classical CPUs, 
                        demonstrating how algorithms are optimised and designed for specific hardware architectures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quantum computers, as we have already seen, have a fundamentally different build 
                        architecture to classical computers. This fact opens up a whole new landscape of 
                        quantum algorithm design: algorithms which make full use of the qubits, quantum 
                        logic gates and the uniquely quantum features of superposition, entanglement (and interference, but I do not touch on this here).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In integer prime factorisation, the most famous context of algorithm design, we 
                        have seen quantum algorithms beat classical algorithms by huge margins; Shor's algorithm, 
                        designed for the quantum computer architecture, makes use of quantum features to 
                        factorise integers exponentially faster than known classical algorithms can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus we have seen, initially at least, that the reason for quantum speed up 
                        is not the hardware the computer is built out of but rather the underlying architecture 
                        design of the computer, allowing algorithms to be designed to take full advantage of 
                        that architecture resulting in much more performant algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, quantum computers are faster, not because of better hardware, but because 
                        of the new quantum computer architecture on which new quantum algorithms can be 
                        designed and run. Quantum computing represents not just a new type of machine, but 
                        a fundamentally different way of thinking about computation.

                    <h2>ARE QUANTUM COMPUTERS MORE 'CAPABLE'?</h2>
                    <p>
                        By this I mean: can a quantum computer 
                        solve problems which a classical computer cannot? This is a tempting, though 
                        false, thought. Here is a simple argument which proves this point:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Classical computers are Turing-complete.</li>
                        <li>Classical computations can be simulated on quantum computers and vice versa.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, quantum computers are Turing-complete.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, quantum computers have no computational advantage (in this sense) over classical computers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This is not to say, of course, that quantum computers have no computational advantage 
                        at all over classical computers. This is just to say that the set of problems that 
                        they are each able to solve is exactly the same. It's just that, as we have already 
                        seen, quantum computers can perhaps solve some of them much more quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But questions remain, even regarding this point. Granted, in the case of integer prime 
                        factorisation, there is the famous example of Shor's algorithm, which trumps all classical 
                        algorithms at this particular problem. But is it the case that, for every problem 
                        solvable with a classical algorithm, a quantum algorithm exists which solves it in a 
                        significantly quicker time? No. Is there any way to know or decide whether, for a given 
                        classical problem-solution, a quantum solution exists? No.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why not? Because, as I claimed earlier, the designing of algorithms to run on a 
                        particular computer architecture is an inherently creative activity. Quantum computers 
                        are not simply 'better' than classical ones. It is perfectly plausible that many problems 
                        (of course, we don't know which) won't benefit from quantum computing and thus classical 
                        computers may well remain superior for some tasks. The best we can say about quantum computers is: they might 
                        be better at solving particular problems but we don't know which. The advantage of quantum 
                        computers is highly problem-specific.

                <div id="whence-the-power">
                    <h2>WHENCE THE POWER OF QUANTUM COMPUTING?</h2>
                    <p>
                        But let us turn to those problems at which we know quantum computers excel, 
                        those problems for which we know we have more performant algorithms. There are 
                        further fascinating  questions to ask: given that we have a more performant algorithm, 
                        what aspect of the quantum architecture is truly 'responsible' for its performance? 
                        The guiding thought here is that there must be a reason, located in the difference between 
                        classical and quantum computer architecture, located in the difference between the laws 
                        of classical bits and the laws of qubits, why such a performant algorithm is possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One suggestion is that it is the uniquely quantum phenomenon of superposition which is 
                        responsible for the quantum speedup. The argument goes, since the qubit exists in a real 
                        superposition of different states, any operation on that qubit as part of the computation 
                        operates 'simultaneously' on all parts of the superposition and thus you have a kind of 
                        parallel computation. It is generally considered uncontroversial that this kind of 'quantum 
                        parallelism' is at least partially responsible for quantum speedup. But there is also 
                        ongoing foundational research into the extent to which entanglement and quantum interference 
                        (which I have not discussed here) contributes to the quantum speedup in certain cases. No doubt the 
                        real answer to this question is that all quantum features are to some extent 'responsible'. But can't we 
                        do better than this? Might it be the case that some algorithms leverage superposition for the quantum speedup, 
                        while for others entanglement or interference play a more significant role?
