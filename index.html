                <h3>Classical Particle Indistinguishability, Precisely</h3>
                <p>I present a new perspective on the meaning of indistinguishability of classical particles. 
                    This leads to a solution to the problem in statistical mechanics of justifying the inclusion of a factor <i>N</i>! in a probability 
                    distribution over the phase space of <i>N</i> indistinguishable classical particles. This paper is forthcoming in <i>The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</i>.

                <h3>Homogeneity and Identity in Thermodynamics</h3>
                <p>In this paper, I provide strictly thermodynamic definitions of 'identity', 'difference' and 'mixture' using a powerful, 
                    but philosophically ignored, formulation of thermodynamics due to Callen (1960). A key contribution stemming from this 
                    formulation is a clear and precise definition of thermodynamic system. I propose to define it as the pair (<i>M, f</i>), where 
                    <i>M</i> is a manifold whose points represent the equilibrium states of the system and <i>f</i> is a function defined on the manifold 
                    called the 'fundamental relation' which contains all thermodynamic information about the system. I then use this definition 
                    to define a criterion of identity which applies to any thermodynamic system, and is based on a key assumption in this 
                    geometric formulation of thermodynamics: the homogeneity of thermodynamic systems, expressing the idea that they 'look the same' 
                    on all scales. This assumption can be manifested precisely in the formalism as a scaling symmetry of the fundamental relation. 
                    Roughly speaking, the basic thought behind the criterion of identity I define is the following: two thermodynamic systems are identical 
                    if they are scaled versions of one another, i.e. if their fundamental relations are identical up to scaling and their manifolds are diffeomorphic. 
                    This criterion is able to recover intuitive results: the composite of two ideal gases which are identical in this sense 
                    form an ideal gas of a larger size, while two ideal gases which are non-identical yield a mixture (a concept which also gets a precise definition).</p>

                <h3>Modality and the Definition of Entropy in Thermodynamics</h3>
                <p>The definition of entropy in thermodynamics rests on the 'existence of reversible processes'. I argue that such an existence claim is modally ambiguous; does this 
                    mean 'there is actually a reversible process' or 'there is in principle a reversible process'? I argue that we should adopt the 
                    former interpretation. The puzzling thing is that the literature is polarized across these two modal interpretations without realizing it. 
                    The difference between these two statements matters because they could each lead to entropy changes in a system which contradict each other. 
                    I show that this disambiguation helps us identify, understand and clear up a confusion in the literature on Gibbs' paradox.</p>
