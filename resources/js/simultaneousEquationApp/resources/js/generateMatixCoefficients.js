/*

The mathematical foundation for finding the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is based on Bézout's identity and modular arithmetic.

**Bézout's Identity:**
Bézout's identity states that for any two integers `a` and `b`, there exist integers `x` and `y` such that:

\[ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\]

where \(\text{gcd}(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

**Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**
The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is an extension of the Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor but also finds the coefficients `x` and `y` such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

**Modular Multiplicative Inverse:**
If we are looking for the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `m`, i.e., a number `x` such that \(ax \equiv 1 \pmod{m}\), we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find `x` and `y` such that \(ax + my = 1\). The modular inverse `x` will be the solution we're looking for.

In the code I provided:

- The `modInverse` function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `m`.
- In the `generateCoefficients` function, we use this `modInverse` function to find the value of `d` such that \(ad \equiv 1 \pmod{b}\), ensuring that the determinant \(ad - bc\) is equal to 1.

This approach is more efficient than incrementing `d` one by one, especially when `a` and `b` are relatively large, because it directly calculates the modular inverse in a more optimized way.
